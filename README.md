# discord-base
The repo for the crate I use to build my bots on top of, made using [Serenity](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity) in Rust!  

## Set up?
IDK myself yet..
It uses the owner and description in [the application page](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
And you can only use `start()`, `utils::log()` and `utils::send_embed()`

## Customise it? You can:
- Obviously edit the config file (Colour, prefix and all)
- Change the path or name of the config file at `start(path: &str)`
- It isn't very customisable because it's for my personal use, you can just edit the code though

## What it can do
- `utils::log()` to DM the owner and `utils::send_embed()` to send a message with an embed
- And `utils::write_and_print()` for when you can't DM the owner, so it logs to a file
- Informs the commander and maybe owner on an error if using `send_embed()`
- Calls `write_and_print()` if `log()` failed
- An `info` command with aliases `about, invite` that gets the desciption and owner from [the application page](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and the GitHub page from the config file
- *And these from Serenity's standard_framework:*
- A nice help command with aliases `commands, cmds`, listing all the other commands and their groups
- Give more information about a command with `help [command name]`
- Suggest similar commands if `help [command name]` is.. well.. similar to another command

## What it will be able to do (soonâ„¢)
- Guild specific prefixes (a `prefix` command)
- Handling permissions
- Localisation, different languages specific to guilds, channels, users (and letting others easily translate them)

## Who am I?
Just some (currently) 17 years old girl from Turkey coding  
Started with Python, gave a shot to JS but now that I know Rust exists never going back  
Basically all I did was Discord bots (at least at the time of writing)  
License and stuff I don't care, neither should you but contact me if you want to ask anything, or donate for some reason

## Contact
- Very Fast: Discord: aria#7553
- Slow: GitHub issues or something
- Way slower (or never, if you're unlucky): wentaas@gmail.com
